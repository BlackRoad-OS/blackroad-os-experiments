## SOUNDBITES FOR INTERVIEWS

> "We broke RSA encryption on $250 of hardware. The quantum threat isn't theoretical—it's mathematical reality."

> "While our simulation doesn't threaten real systems today, it proves that when large-scale quantum computers arrive, current encryption will fall."

> "Organizations have 10-15 years to transition to post-quantum cryptography. The window is closing."

> "For $250, anyone can learn quantum computing. For $10 million, you can buy an IBM quantum computer. The knowledge is accessible to everyone—including adversaries."

> "This isn't fear-mongering. This is mathematics, demonstrated on consumer hardware, 100% reproducible."
